What seems to be the problem? #Detective
Sir, our town really needs your help. In the past few weeks, several women have gone missing. Now one of them has turned up dead. #Arthur
Several women!? A few weeks?! Were any policemen assigned the cases of the missing women? #Detective
Yes, people have communicated with some police officers about the situation but none of them have been doing much. That’s why we are communicating the issue with you since it has evolved into a murder.  #Arthur
Did you know the victim? #Detective
No, but my daughter was kidnapped. I fear she might be the next one to turn up dead. #Arthur
....Well no time to waste then. Head back to your house and I’ll meet you there shortly. I have some things I need to ask about here at the office. #Detective
