What seems to be the problem? #Detective
 Detective, our town really needs your help. In the past few weeks, two women have gone missing. Now one of them has turned up dead. #Arthur
Two women, and you waited A few weeks to tell me?! Were any policemen assigned the cases of the missing women? #Detective
Yes, people told some police officers about the situation but they haven’t really helped anything. That’s why I’ve come directly to you, we don’t have a lot to offer you, but we really really need your help now.  #Arthur
Did you know the victim? #Detective
No, but my daughter was kidnapped. I fear she might be the next one to turn up dead. #Arthur
....Well no time to waste then. Head back to your house and I’ll meet you there shortly. I need to talk to the officers here to get some details about this situation. #Detective
