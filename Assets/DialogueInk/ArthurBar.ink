I thought I told you to stay at home. #Detective
Sorry Detective, I just couldn’t be alone with my thoughts anymore. #Arthur
How much have you drunk? #Detective
This is my second drink, Henry gave me the first one on the house. #Arthur
Who? #Detective
My bad, the bartender Henry Windsor. Great guy. #Arthur
I’ll buy you one more drink, but then I’m escoring you back to your house. #Detective
Aye aye Detective, Henry my receipt please. #Arthur
